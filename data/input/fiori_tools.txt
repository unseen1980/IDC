Developing SAP Fiori Applications with SAP Fiori Tools To develop an application that connects to SAP data sources, you can use one of the following options: 
SAP Fiori elements creates standard applications based on several basic floorplans for common business scenarios. These floorplans provide UI code, including some logic, so that the data from the back end goes exactly where it’s supposed to, and the UI behavior is based on the metadata you provide. You can customize the floorplans using XML annotations. 
freestyle SAPUI5 gives you complete flexibility about your application's look and performance. You can select floorplans and specify the layout, flow, menu structure, colors, fonts, interactions, patterns, and more. For each screen, you have to write the JavaScript UI code, which may be time-consuming. 
What Is SAP Fiori Elements? 
SAP Fiori elements is one of the options available to develop SAP Fiori apps based on SAPUI5. SAP Fiori elements provide designs for UI patterns and predefined templates for common application use cases. Using standard templates as the starting point for creating applications increases developer efficiency, enforces UX consistency across apps, and ensure that applications created using SAP Fiori elements include features expected in a typical enterprise. 
Application developers can use SAP Fiori elements to create SAP Fiori apps based on an OData service and annotations that do not need JavaScript UI coding to create a front end of their app. This means that no application-specific view instances are required. The SAP Fiori elements runtime interprets the metadata and annotations of the underlying OData service and uses the corresponding views for the SAP Fiori apps at startup. SAP Fiori apps are created with SAPUI5 and follow the SAP Fiori design guidelines to ensure consistency and high quality. For more information, see SAP Fiori Design Guidelines. 
For more information about SAP Fiori apps, see http://www.sap.com/fiori   . 
For more information about SAP Fiori, see SAP Fiori Overview. 
For more information about SAP Fiori elements, see Developing Apps with SAP Fiori elements. 
Project Structure and Artifacts of SAP Fiori elements 
The SAP Fiori elements framework interprets OData metadata and annotations to render the application UI. While the metadata describe your data model or what is on your screen, the annotations describe your data semantics or the visualization. 
For example, any entity type property that has the Communication.IsEmailAddress annotation term set to true is interpreted by the SAP Fiori elements framework as an e-mail address and displayed in an application UI as a clickable link that leads to the e-mail client. 
Annotations can be associated to entities, relationships, and properties of a service. 
You can also use annotations to perform the following actions: 
Describe the relationships between properties, such as between an amount and the related currency. SAP Fiori elements display these properties side by side in an application UI. 
Group properties together so that they are displayed next to each other in a form. 
Describe the actions available on a given object, whether you can edit it, delete it, apply some filters, and more. All of this is interpreted by the SAP Fiori elements framework and shown in the application accordingly. 
This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit SAP Help Portal. 2
9/5/25, 7:12 PM 
Annotations can be defined together with the metadata or in dedicated annotation files, both in the back end along with the service, and in the frontend, in the local annotation files. 
For an annotation to be considered by the SAP Fiori elements framework during runtime, it must reside in an annotation source registered in an application descriptor file manifest.json of the application. 
Additionally, in the web app manifest, the description of your application basic metadata can be found, such as its name and version, as well as its content, such as application pages, navigation, service details used, and more. 
The same descriptor file manifest.json that is a runtime source for your annotations can be used for the following operations: 
Adding navigation from pages, such as a drill down from a List Report to an Object Page. For more information, see Define Application Structure. 
Defining the settings of tables, columns, or other UI elements. In addition, registering custom extensions like custom columns, pages or sections. 
For flex changes in the individual pages, such as enabling export, you can use the Page Editor. 
What Is Freestyle SAPUI5? 
Freestyle SAPUI5 is another option available to develop SAP Fiori apps. Choose the type of template required, along with the relevant OData service to start your application development process. By using the freestyle SAPUI5 templates, you can be flexible in creating a custom application based on an OData service and JavaScript UI coding. freestyle SAPUI5 incorporates our latest recommendations and can be used as a starting point for developing custom apps according to the SAP Fiori design. For more information, see SAP Fiori Design Guidelines. 
For more information about SAP Fiori apps, see http://www.sap.com/fiori   . 
For more information about SAPUI5, see Get Started with UI5. 
Project Structure and Artifacts of Freestyle SAPUI5 
With the freestyle SAPUI5 framework, you can optimize your SAP Fiori-based development by using OData and SAPUI5 tooling to render the application UI. The SAPUI5 controls are convenient and intuitive to use for your app development. Additionally, they ensure adherence to the design guidelines. 
The freestyle SAPUI5 templates create at least three basic files for your application: 
manifest.json 
app.view.xml 
component.js 
With each of these files, you can control certain aspects of your application. For more information, see Basic Files for your App   . 
 Note 
The freestyle SAPUI5 templates are deprecated, and it’s recommended to use the custom page SAP Fiori template based on the flexible programming model as an alternative. For more information, see Flexible Programming Model   .

Migration 
SAP Fiori tools provides a migration utility to help move your SAP Fiori projects from other services, such as SAP Web IDE, to Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or SAP Business Application Studio. Note that SAP Web IDE can still be used if you have a productive SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) global account and have activated SAP Web IDE there. However, it is no longer possible to access SAP Web IDE using an SAP BTP free tier account. 
Some of the key points for migration: 
Imported and cloned projects are auto-detected for migration. 
SAP Fiori elements, freestyle SAPUI5, SAPUI5 Adaptation Projects, and SAPUI5 Extensibility are supported. You can migrate multiple projects at once. 
Migration doesn't update the deployment configuration. Please run npm run deploy-config after migration to configure the migrated application for deployment. 
A project must have the main data source specified in the manifest.appdescr_variant file. 
For more information about extensibility, please see Extending an SAP Fiori Application. 
 Note 
As of Adaptation Project tooling 1.1.60, adaptation projects provide an Adaptation Editor in SAP Business Application Studio. To support this editor, existing SAPUI5 adaptation projects that have already been migrated to support SAP Fiori tools can be migrated again. Once migrated, the new Adaptation Editor will be available for use. 
Prerequisites 
Ensure that you've installed the latest SAP Fiori tools extensions. For more information, see Getting Started with SAP Fiori Tools. 
Ensure that your SAP Fiori project is running as expected in SAP Web IDE and belongs to the supported project types: SAP Fiori elements V2 
SAP Fiori elements V4 
freestyle SAPUI5 
Extension project 
Recommendations 
In SAP Business Application Studio, a destination of the target system needs to be defined that reflects the system used in the original application. For more information, see SAP Business Application Studio Help Portal. 
 Note 
If the target system isn’t defined, previewing an application with live data won’t work. 
In VS Code, you need to know the target system hostname and/or client. 
We recommend that the migrated project is under a version control system. 
Migration Steps 
This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit SAP Help Portal. 16
9/5/25, 7:12 PM 
1. Clone your project from git by using the command line or import your project to the workspace as follows: Click File Open Workspace and create a workspace in the projects folder. 
Export the project from SAP Web IDE to your computer. 
Unzip the project on your computer. 
Drag the project to the workspace of VS Code or SAP Business Application Studio. 
2. Click Start Migration from the pop-up window. 
A new Migration view opens listing all the projects from your workspace. For each project listed, the type of the project is also displayed. If the tool finds no suitable project for migration in your workspace, a message is shown. 
 Tip 
You can also open the Migration view anytime by opening the Command Palette ( CMD/CTRL + Shift + P ) and executing the Fiori: Migrate Project for use in Fiori tools command. 
3. Select the project that you want to migrate from the list of projects by selecting the corresponding checkbox. You can choose to manually add a project from the filesystem by clicking Add Project. If the supplied folder has an application that can be migrated, it's added to your list of projects. At any point, you can click the Refresh button to reload the projects from your workspace again. 
4. For each listed project, if applicable, fill in the respective columns based on the information provided below: 
Name 
	Description
	Application 
Identifier
	The identifier of the project from the manifest.json or pom.xml.
	Project Path 
	The file path to the location of the project.
	SAP System 
	A dropdown detailing the SAP system that should be used in migration. The dropdown lists all the saved systems in VS Code or all the destinations available in SAP Business Application Studio. In SAP Business Application Studio, an entry is preselected if the destination name found in neo-app.json exactly matches a destination available to the user in their subaccount. Selecting an SAP System from the dropdown sets the hostname and client automatically.
	Destination 
	A free-text field that by default contains the system name from the project being migrated. It should default to the destination from the source project neo-app.json. Destination is only used by SAP Fiori tools in SAP Business Application Studio and not in VS Code. To make a project compatible, please provide a Destination and Hostname 
that is accessible to both. Use a destination for the front-end server that has SAPUI5 libraries installed rather than connecting to the back-end OData server directly.
	Hostname 
	An input box detailing the back-end hostname to be used in migration. It should be a valid URL or blank. This hostname is only used by SAP Fiori tools in VS Code.
	SAP Client 
	An optional numeric field detailing the SAP client to be used in migration. Should be provided in case the client isn’t the system default.
	SAPUI5 
Version
	A dropdown detailing the version of SAPUI5 to be used when previewing the migrated application locally. Defaults to the version from neo-app.json if defined, otherwise uses the minUI5Version in the manifest.json file. 
 Note 
For SAPUI5 Extensibility Projects, currently the minimum version required is 1.71.0.
	



This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit SAP Help Portal. 17
9/5/25, 7:12 PM 
5. Click Start Migration. 
At this point, your selected projects are migrated and required packages are installed. 
 Note 
After the successful migration of your SAP Fiori elements project, you can view the Application Information for the respective project. To do so, click View Info under the Action column of the migration results view. The Application Information tab is displayed automatically if only a single SAP Fiori elements project is migrated. 
To migrate more projects, press the Back button from the results view. 
For more information, see Application Information. 
Files Updated During Migration 
The migration process modifies several files in your existing project. The following table lists the files that will be updated during migration: 
Name 
	Description
	.gitignore 
	A new file to be added with the build artifacts and libraries to be ignored.
	package-lock.json 
	A file deleted and re-created during migration to reflect updated libraries.
	package.json 
	Removes SAPUI5 SAP Web IDE specific libraries. 
Updates the npm scripts with SAP Fiori tooling targets and dependencies. 
Presence of sapux:true and ui5-tooling library identifies the project as one that supports SAP Fiori tools.
	ui5-local.yaml 
	A new file that supports offline development, downloads ui5 libraries locally, and runs against mock data.
	ui5.yaml 
	Removes the SAP Web IDE builder tasks. SAP Fiori 
deployment tasks are added later when you add the 
deployment configuration to your project. 
Reminds of file changes, supports the proxy middleware and live reload functionality.
	index.html 
	A new file supporting a stand-alone preview of your application without SAP Fiori launchpad. Now, you can start your app with or without SAP Fiori launchpad.
	manifest.json 
	It’s populated by SAP Fiori tools.
	changes_loader.js 
	A new static file that supports live reload of the application.
	changes_preview.js 
	A new static file that supports .changes file from adaptation updates.
	



flpSandbox.html This file is updated by migration to support the preview and changes loader. The following differences to the old file version can 
be defined: 
This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit SAP Help Portal. 18
9/5/25, 7:12 PM 
Name 
	Description
	

	The migration tool changes the paths to the ui5 libraries so that they’re proxied through the back end and allows the update of the ui5 version at runtime. 
Updated to recommended config.
	locate-reuse-libs.js 
	A new static file that finds any custom reuse libraries referenced in your manifest file and queries them with the back-end server to see if the libraries are installed. If so, it registers them at runtime so that they’re available.
	flpSandboxMockServer.html 
	Applies the same changes as the flpSandbox.html file but with the mock server support.
	



 Note 
If the source project doesn’t contain a webapp folder, then one is created during migration and the relevant HTML and JavaScript files are moved to this location. 
Verification 
1. Review the file changes in the Source Control view. Check for any project-specific changes that may be overwritten and consider reapplying as appropriate. 
2. To ensure your SAP Fiori tools application works as expected, launch any of the SAP Fiori tools commands, such as Page Map, Fiori: Open Application Generator, or Fiori: Open Guided Development. 
 Note 
Some SAP Fiori apps might be missing files like metadata.xml before migration, which can impact some of the SAP Fiori tools features. To avoid this, after migration, make sure that you sync the OData service using Service Manager. For more information, see Managing Service and Annotations Files.

Importing an Application 
You can manually import an existing SAP Fiori application from the SAPUI5 ABAP repository to SAP Business Application Studio or Visual Studio Code (VS Code). 
Preparation Steps 
Before importing an application, in your workspace in either SAP Business Application Studio or VS Code, create new folders with the following names: 
Name 
	Description
	restore-from-exported 
	This folder contains the restored app.
	



This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit SAP Help Portal. 19
9/5/25, 7:12 PM 
Name 
	Description
	restore-from-exported/webapp 
	This folder will contain the content of the downloaded zip/tgz.
	



Import Steps 
 Note 
The BSP application code is normally minified before deployment, and so the resulting code that is downloaded is also the minified version. We recommend that you only use this import procedure if the application code is not already available under source control. 
The -dbg.js file, such as (Component-dbg.js), contains the original un-minified code. You can copy its contents into the corresponding .js file, for example, Component-dbg.js Component.js for more human readable code. 
Remove -dbg.js, -preload.js and .js.map before running UI5 CLI build, otherwise they are recreated in the dist folder. 
To import SAP Fiori apps from the SAPUI5 ABAP repository, perform the following steps: 
1. Login to your SAPUI5 ABAP back-end system and navigate to the transaction SE80. 
2. Run the report /UI5/UI5_REPOSITORY_LOAD. 
3. Provide the name of the SAPUI5 application and click Download. 
4. Choose an empty folder for the download target. 
5. From the resulting view, download the files as a .zip file using the button Click here to Download at the end of the page. 6. Extract the .zip file into the folder restore-from-exported/webapp. 
Verify that the manifest.json is located at restore-from-exported/webapp/manifest.json. 
7. Create a package.json in the folder restore-from-exported. The name value should match the application name in manifest.json. 
{ 
 "name": "sap.fe.demo.awesomeapp", 
} 
You can see the original application name and namespace in the manifest.json file. For example: 
{ 
 "sap.app": { 
 "id": "sap.fe.demo.awesomeapp", 
 .. 
} 
8. In SAP Business Application Studio or VS Code workspace, start the migration command Fiori: Migrate Project for use in Fiori tools if not already prompted to do so. 
9. The project should be found in restore-from-exported and listed for migration. 
10. Choose the appropriate options and migrate the project. 
11. The project is now compatible with SAP Fiori tools. 
This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit SAP Help Portal. 20
9/5/25, 7:12 PM 
ABAP Development Tools Integration 
You can launch the SAP Fiori Generator directly when working with ABAP Development Tools (ADT) in Eclipse. You can either launch the Application Generator from SAP Fiori tools in SAP Business Application Studio in your browser, or directly launch Visual Studio Code (VS Code) locally if that is your preferred integrated development environment (IDE). 
First, you configure the integration between ADT and SAP Fiori tools. This is a one-time setup within ADT for each system you want to integrate. Proceed as follows: 
1. Choose the system you want to integrate, right-click it and select Properties. Then click ABAP Development IDE Configuration . 
2. Select the Configure the target IDE checkbox and choose to launch either SAP Business Application Studio or VS Code. 
After the configuration, a new button is displayed alongside the service details in ADT. Create Fiori Project allows you to launch your IDE environment and automatically start the SAP Fiori Generator with these system details. 
When you launch the SAP Fiori Generator, the data source selection step is skipped since you’ve already selected your data source in ADT, and the main entity for your template is pre-selected with the entity you chose in ADT. 
Alternatively, if you have used the Quick Fiori Application generator in ADT to already deploy an application with the selected service, then you can click Create Fiori Project to launch SAP Fiori tools and download the deployed application into your workspace. After it is downloaded, the application is updated to support the capabilities of SAP Fiori tools. 
Finally, executing the Fiori: Download ADT Deployed App from SAPUI5 ABAP Repository command in your IDE environment allows you to directly download an application that was deployed from ADT, without needing to launch ADT. Choose your desired system from the dropdown and you are presented with a list of SAP Fiori applications that were deployed from ADT. 
 Note 
For the integration with VS Code, please ensure you have saved your ABAP system with the same system URL that is used by ADT. To check, click SAP Fiori ( ) on the activity toolbar from the left side, then click SAP Systems. If the saved system cannot be matched after launching from ADT, you can choose any of the existing systems you have already saved. If you already 
have any SAP Fiori projects in your workspace that use the same system and main entity, you'll get the option to choose an existing matching SAP Fiori project or to create a new one with the SAP Fiori Generator. 
Telemetry 
You can enable and disable the collection of analytics for SAP Fiori tools. If enabled, non-personally identifiable information is used to help understand how you use the product to improve SAP Fiori tools. 
To enable or disable telemetry: 
Open the Command Palette ( CMD/CTRL + Shift + P ) and execute the Fiori: Change Telemetry Settings command. 
Report Issues and Security

If you can't find an answer in SAP Community or need additional assistance, create an incident in SAP Support Portal under component: CA-UX-IDE. See Contact SAP Support. 
Security 
The following best practices are suggested when using SAP Fiori tools: 
Follow the software development security guidance provided by your organization. 
Avoid using OData services hosted on a production system for developing an SAP Fiori application. 
Don't use the same user credentials to access development and production systems for the OData service. Use a trusted NPM registry. 
Follow the security guidelines for the required software you are using. 
Ensure that you use a source control system and are regularly committing code to it. 
Ensure that you verify the content of your PATH variable. Commands like node or cds, which are usually part of the PATH variable and which can be executed from any directory in the terminal, need to point to a trusted origin.

Application SAPUI5 Version 
Minimum SAPUI5 Version 
The minimum SAPUI5 version declares the version which is required at runtime to support the features used in application development. It is set using the minUI5Version property in the manifest.json file. For more information, see Descriptor for Applications, Components, and Libraries (manifest.json) 
 Sample Code 
JSON 
{ 
 "sap.ui5": { 
 "dependencies": { 
 "minUI5Version": "1.120.4" 
 } 
 } 
} 
If the target system does not have the required minimum SAPUI5 version, a warning message appears when deploying your application. For more information, see Deploying an Application. The minimum SAPUI5 version is set during generation when selecting a version for the project and can also be changed using the Fiori: Change Minimum SAPUI5 Version command. 
It is also used to determine which version of the @sap/ux-specification module is installed to provide the matching feature set in Application Modeler and Guided Development. Changing the minimum SAPUI5 version with the Fiori: Change Minimum SAPUI5 Version command will update the @sap/ux-specification module if needed. 
SAPUI5 Preview Version 
The application's minimum SAPUI5 version is used by default for previewing an application in the development environment. You can use a different version by creating a run configuration. For more information, see Previewing an Application. 
The SAPUI5 preview version is fetched by default from https://ui5.sap.com. If the requested version is not found, the next higher available version is used. You can set different source paths and different default SAPUI5 preview versions by configuring @sap/ux-ui5-tooling. For more information, see @sap/ux-ui5-tooling . 
SAPUI5 Deployed Version 
The SAPUI5 version used for a deployed application depends on the target platform and whether an application is running standalone or embedded in the SAP Fiori launchpad. 
ABAP Environment 
SAP Fiori launchpad 
This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit SAP Help Portal. 23
9/5/25, 7:12 PM 
SAP Fiori applications deployed to an ABAP environment and embedded in SAP Fiori launchpad will use the SAPUI5 version deployed in the backend. Therefore, you should use the same SAPUI5 version in your project. 
Standalone 
If the application is running standalone using a deployed index.html, then the version depends on the configuration in the index.html file. Applications generated with the SAP Fiori Generator contain an index.html file with a relative path to the host: 
 Sample Code 
HTML 
<script id="sap-ui-bootstrap" src="resources/sap-ui-core.js"> 
These applications will also use the SAPUI5 version installed in the backend system. Their path can be modified to load resources directly from https://ui5.sap.com or a specific SAPUI5 version: 
 Sample Code 
HTML 
<script id="sap-ui-bootstrap" src="https://ui5.sap.com/1.114.12/resources/sap-ui-core.js"> 
Cloud Foundry Environment 
SAP Build Work Zone Service 
SAP Fiori applications deployed to Cloud Foundry run in an iFrame using the SAPUI5 version of the backend. For more information, see SAP Build Work Zone. 
Standalone 
If the application is running standalone, the Fiori: Add Deployment Configuration command adds a route to a destination for SAPUI5 resources to the xs-app.json: 
 Sample Code 
JSON 
{ 
 "routes": [ 
 { 
 "source": "^/resources/(.*)$", 
 "target": "/resources/$1", 
 "authenticationType": "none", 
 "destination": "ui5" 
 } 
 ] 
} 
Also, an instance based destination pointing to https://ui5.sap.com is added to the mta.yaml: 
This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit SAP Help Portal. 24
9/5/25, 7:12 PM 
 Sample Code 
YAML 
instance: 
 destinations: 
 - Authentication: NoAuthentication 
 Name: ui5 
 ProxyType: Internet 
 Type: HTTP 
 URL: https://ui5.sap.com 
By default, the application uses the latest SAPUI5 version. This can be changed in the mta.yaml or by configuring the generated destination service using SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). You can also replace the instance based destination with an account level destination. For more information, see Configure Application Routing (xs-app.json). 
Data Editor 
Previewing the application using npm run start-mock generates mock data on the fly. If you want to generate mock data and store it in the .json file format, you can right-click on your project and launch Open Data Editor. Once generated, mock data is stored in the .json format under the /webapp/localService/mockdata file. 
 Note 
You need to configure mock server prior to using npm run start-mock. See Installing MockServer. 
For templates like the Overview Page where there are multiple services, you will see a drop-down list to select the metadata file you want to use. If your application is running, you can stop the mock server by pressing Ctrl + C . 

Data Editor reads the metadata.xml file that is defined in the manifest.json under the dataSource and generates mock data based on the property type. 
Data can be edited by either double-clicking in the cell of the Data Editor or by editing the Entity.json file. This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit SAP Help Portal. 25
9/5/25, 7:12 PM 
If the mock server isn’t running, you can: 
Make changes in the Data Editor, automatically reflected in the .json file. 
If changes are made in the .json file, click the Refresh button to update the canvas. 
If the mock server is running: 
Add the watch: true parameter to the ui5-mock.yaml to update the canvas. 
This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit SAP Help Portal. 26

Supported Floorplans 
This is a list of supported floorplans that give you the ability to create SAP Fiori elements applications based on them. 
List Report Object Page 
With the list report object page, users can view and work with a large set of items. This floorplan offers powerful features for finding and acting on relevant items. It’s often used as an entry point for navigating to the item details, which are shown on the object page. 
For more information, see List Report or Object Page . 
Worklist 
The worklist displays a collection of items that the user needs to process. Working through the list usually involves reviewing details of the items and taking action. In most cases, the user has to either complete a work item or delegate it. 
The focus of the worklist floorplan is on processing items. This differs from the list report floorplan, which focuses on finding and acting on relevant items from a large dataset. 
You can use any List Report and Object Page option to configure Worklist. 
For more information about Fiori Design Guidelines, see Worklist Floorplan . 
 Note 
For worklist floorplans using an OData V4 data source, only SAPUI5 versions 1.99 and above are supported. 
For information on what is supported in worklist for OData V2, see Floorplan Properties. 
Analytical List Page 
The analytical list page offers a unique way to analyze data step by step from different perspectives to investigate the root cause of any deviations, spikes, and abnormalities through drilldown, and to act on transactional content. All this can be done seamlessly within one page. The purpose of the analytical list page is to identify problem areas within datasets or significant single instances using data visualization and business intelligence. 
This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit SAP Help Portal. 43
9/5/25, 7:12 PM 
Visualization helps users to recognize facts and situations, and to reduce the number of interaction steps needed to gain insights or to identify significant single instances. Chart visualization enables users to spot relevant data more quickly. 
The main target group are users who work on transactional content. They benefit from fully transparent business object data and direct access to business actions. In addition, they have access to analytical views and functions without having to switch between systems. These include KPIs, a visual filter where filter values are enriched by measures and visualizations, and a combined table or chart view with drill-in capabilities (hybrid view). Users can interact with the chart to look deep into the data. The visualization enables them to identify spikes, deviations, and abnormalities more quickly, and to take appropriate action right away. 
For more information, see Analytical List Page . 
 Note 
For analytical list page floorplans using an Odata V4 data source, only SAPUI5 versions 1.90 and above are supported. 
Overview Page 
The overview page is a data-driven SAP Fiori application type and floorplan that provides all the information the user needs on a single page, based on the user specific domain or role. It allows the user to focus on the most important tasks, and view, filter, and react to the information quickly. 
Each task or topic is represented by a card or a content container. The overview page acts as a UI framework for organizing multiple cards on a single page. 
The overview page is based on SAP Fiori elements technology, and uses annotated views of app data, meaning that the app content can be tailored to the domain or SAP Fiori elements role. Different types of cards allow you to visualize information in an attractive and efficient way. 
For more information, see Overview Page . 
Form entry object page 
The form entry object page allows users to create an application with an object page and a generated form. The object page floorplan enables end-users to provide data entry in the generated application. 
For more information, see Object Page . 
Flexible programming model 
The flexible programming model makes it easy for you to extend apps based on SAP Fiori elements for OData V4. You can use any SAPUI5 coding or controls in extension points, and take advantage of the provided building blocks. 
For more information, see Flexible Programming Model. 
Data Source 
This section provides information on how to connect your application with a data source during generation. 
 Tip

When connecting for the first time, only the New System option is available. 
Using a saved system 
1. Select a previously saved system. 
The wizard skips the authentication if your saved system credentials are still valid. 
2. If saved authentication details are invalid, you’ll be prompt to reauthenticate. For example, if your password is expired. 
Connect to an SAP system using SAP Business Application Studio 
When using the SAP Fiori application generator in SAP Business Application Studio, you can select from a list of destinations that are configured for the SAP Business Application Studio instance. The generator automatically retrieves the available destinations to select from. If you do not have the correct access to use the destination endpoint, an error occurs. 
The destinations are expected to have a catalog service that provides a list of ODataV2 and V4 services that are available. 
If you want to use a destination to reference a service URL endpoint, see Connect to an OData Service with a customized URL. 
 Note 
In SAP Business Application Studio, to create a SAP Fiori elements application in SAP BTP ABAP environment: OrgManager 
SpaceManager 
SpaceDeveloper 
Connect to an OData Service with a Customized URL 
If the OData endpoint that you want to use in your application can't be accessed directly, you can set it up as a destination and directly reference it in the generator. To do so, perform the following steps: 
1. In SAP Business Application Studio, launch the SAP Fiori application generator and select the required template. 2. Select Connect to an OData Service from the data source drop-down list. 
3. For the data source URL field, use the destination name followed by .dest. In this case, SAP Business Application Studio should be able to route to your service with the destination name. 
 Example 
If the URL defined in the Destination is https://someurl.com/someservice, you must be with the destination name MyDestination, the following URL will be used in the SAP Fiori application generator: 
https://MyDestination.dest/someservice 
Connect to an OData Service 
Enter the OData endpoint URL to generate your application. 
All OData endpoints that are either authenticated or unauthenticated are supported. 
This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit SAP Help Portal. 46
9/5/25, 7:12 PM 
The OData endpoint must be the correct version of the template that you’ve selected. For example, a OData V2 endpoint must be provided for an OData V2 template. The wizard informs you in case of any mismatch between the OData version and the template version. 
 Note 
If necessary, the system prompts you to provide your name and password. 
Upload a Metadata Document 
Upload a metadata XML file that you want to use. Now, you can generate the application without relying on a back-end service being available. 
Only EDMX format is supported for the metadata XML file. 
After the metadata XML file is validated, you can select the required entity options for the application. 
 Note 
Using the metadata.xml file restricts the generated application to only mock data. 
Connect to SAP Business Accelerator Hub 
 Caution 
SAP Business Accelerator Hub has been deprecated from the Application Generator as a data source and will be removed in a future release. We strongly recommend that you use the Service Center in SAP Business Application Studio to generate applications if you intend to still use SAP Business Accelerator Hub. 
For more information, see Service Center. 
When users don't have their data source available, they can generate an application with the SAP Business Accelerator Hub. This data source is only intended to support development and must be replaced with a real data source before going live. 
 Note 
Ensure that you logged in to https://api.sap.com/ at least once before connecting to SAP Business Accelerator Hub. 
In the Data Source and Service Selection wizard page, select Connect to SAP Business Accelerator Hub from the Data source dropdown list.

Use a Local CAP Project 
You can either select a local SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) project that has been detected in your workspace, or manually select the CAP project folder path and the generator will retrieve the services that are defined for that project. 
 Note 
A local CAP Project data source is limited to the List Report Object Page and Analytical List Page templates that are based on OData V4. This option is not available for the Worklist and Overview Page templates. 
 Note 
OData V2 Support for CAP - While CAP defaults to OData service V4, the latest protocol version, some projects need to fallback to OData service V2, for example, to keep using existing V2-based UIs. SAP Fiori tools does not recommend and support having both OData service V2 and OData service V4 applications in the app folder within the CAP project. In case, you have a requirement to create both OData service V2 and OData service V4 applications, it is recommended that you generate the OData service V2 app outside of the CAP project. 
For more information about CAP services, see: https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/about/ .

If the URL defined in the Destination is https://someurl.com/someservice with the destination name MyDestination, the following URL will be used in the SAP Fiori generator: 
https://MyDestination.dest/someservice 
Connect to an OData Service 
Enter the OData endpoint URL to generate your application. All OData endpoints that are either authenticated with basic authentication or unauthenticated are supported. 
 Note 
The provided OData endpoint must be the correct version for the template that you select. For example, an OData V2 endpoint must be provided for the OData V2 template. The wizard informs you if there is any mismatch between the OData version and the template version. 
If necessary, the system prompts you to provide your name and password. 
Upload a Metadata Document 
To generate the application without relying on a back end service being available, upload a metadata.xml file that you want to use. 
Only EDMX format is supported for the metadata.xml file. 
Once the metadata.xml file has been validated, the system allows you to select the required entity options for the application. 
 Note 
When using a metadata.xml file, the generated application is limited to only mock data. 
Connect to SAP Business Accelerator Hub 
 Caution

TypeScript support in a CAP application requires npm workspaces to be enabled as detailed above. 
Generating an MTA Deployment File 
In the MTA deployment scenario, developers can generate an app router configuration, that contains the mta.yaml file, and then add multiple generated SAP Fiori apps to the app router configuration project. To do so, open the Command Palette ( CMD/CTRL + Shift + P ) and execute the Fiori: Open CF Application Router Generator command. 

The user can manage the source code of the app router configuration and multiple SAP Fiori elements projects under a single root directory. 
The app router configuration project has the following structure: 
router - The folder that contains the app router configuration. 
 Note 
This folder can have a different name, such as configurable. 
.gitignore - The file that contains the list of files to be ignored by source control. 
mta.yaml - The file that contains the MTA configuration. 
package-lock.json - The file is generated automatically for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree or package.json file and describes the exact tree that was generated. 
package.json - The file that contains specifics of npm package.json. 
Once the app router configuration project is generated, one or more SAP Fiori apps can be generated inside its root directory by using the SAP Fiori application generator. 
 Note

This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit SAP Help Portal. 60
9/5/25, 7:12 PM 
Adding Deployment Configuration to an Existing MTA Deployment File 
When the user selects a project folder path for an application and an MTA file already exists in the selected folder, the SAP Fiori application generator automatically switches to Yes for adding deployment configuration. During the generation of an application, the generator updates the MTA project file by default with the supplied deployment configuration. 

 Note 
For successful deployment of the generated application, the MTA file must already have the required services defined, depending on whether the application has to be deployed by using the managed, Application Frontend service, or standalone application router. To ensure the required services are added to the MTA deployment file, use the MTA generator provided by SAP Fiori tools or the Application Router generator in SAP Business Application Studio. For more information, see Generating an MTA Deployment File. 
 Note 
For local CAP projects, you can optionally chose to generate an instance based destination as part of CF deployment configuration, or use an existing instance based destination that is already defined in your MTA deployment file. 
Creating an MTA Deployment File during Application Generation 
If the MTA deployment file is not available in the project folder location, you can create a new file. To do so, when adding deployment configuration, select Cloud Foundry as the target landscape. In this case, the relevant MTA file to be used with a managed application router will be added to the same folder as your generated SAP Fiori application. 
 Note 
In this scenario, the generated MTA file is not applicable for use with multiple applications, as it is contained in the same folder as the SAP Fiori application. We recommend that you first create the MTA file and then generate the SAP Fiori application in a subfolder. 
This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit SAP Help Portal. 61

1. Update the package.json file: 
"devDependencies": { "eslint": "5.16.x", "@sap/eslint-plugin-ui5-jsdocs": "2.0.x", "@sapui5/t 2. Add tsconfig.json with the following content to the root folder : 
{ "compilerOptions": { "module": "none", "noEmit": true, "checkJs": true, "allowJs": true, "t 3. Add the .eslintrc file with the following content to the root folder: 
{ "plugins": ["@sap/ui5-jsdocs"], "extends": ["plugin:@sap/ui5-jsdocs/recommended", "eslint:r 4. Delete the node_modules folder and execute npm install. 
Open a .js file to see the code completion for SAPUI5: 
Security Certificate 
This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit SAP Help Portal. 62
9/5/25, 7:12 PM 
During application generation, SAP Fiori application generator rejects the connection request and reports an error if the certificate was generated using a local certificate authority that is unknown to the operating system. 
We recommend that you fix this error by installing the required certificates using the instructions below. You can choose to ignore the error and continue generation with the invalid certificate but this is not recommended. 
 Tip 
Please ensure you have Node.js installed locally. For more information, see Visual Studio Code. 
 Note 
The instructions below are applicable when the security certificate is valid, but it is using a local certificate authority that is unknown to the operating system. 
If the SSL certificate is invalid such as an expired certificate, wrong host, or unable to verify the leaf signature, you can use the NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 environment variable to ignore the error. However, it is recommended that the SSL certificate error is resolved rather than ignoring the error. 
1. Ensure that you have a copy of the local certificate authority saved locally. 
 Note 
Create or select a folder to store your downloaded certificate. To export the certificate from your browser, follow the instructions based on your web browser. 
2. Once the certificate file is downloaded, the issue can be resolved for VS Code by importing it into your global certificate store. To do so, perform the following steps: 
Microsoft Windows 
Right-click the CA certificate file and select Install Certificate. 
Follow the prompts to add the certificate to the trust store either for the current user or for all users. 
macOS. 
Right-click the CA certificate file. 
Select Open With and naviagte to Keychain Access. 
Select System as the keychain to import into. 
3. To resolve the issue for using the command line with Yeoman, set the following environment variable to point to the location of the downloaded certificate file: NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS 
Microsoft Windows: 
Right-click the  (Computer) icon and select Properties. Alternatively, in Windows Control Panel, select 
System. 
Microsoft Windows 10 
Right-click Windows Start Button and select System. 
In System Settings under Related Settings, select System info. 
Select Advanced system settings. 
On the Advanced tab, select Environment Variables. 
This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit SAP Help Portal. 63
9/5/25, 7:12 PM 
macOS 
Click New to create a new environment variable. 
Add NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS and ensure the value points to the downloaded certificate file that is stored in the folder from Step 1. 
Click Apply and then OK for the changes to take effect. 
In the command-line terminal, before executing the Yeoman command to run the generators, execute the following command: 
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=path/to/certificate/file

Generating an Application with the Project Accelerator or Joule Using SAP Fiori Tools AI 
You can use the Project Accelerator, from SAP Fiori tools AI, or Joule to generate data models, services, sample data, and an SAP Fiori UI for your project based on your business requirements. 
You can use the Project Accelerator or Joule to kick-start your SAP Fiori development by directly translating your business requirements into a CAP project with a single SAP Fiori elements application. Your business requirements can consist of text, images, or text and images. The generated application can consist of just a list report, a list report page with one or multiple object pages, or a form entry object page. 
The following video shows an overview of the Project Accelerator: Project Accelerator: Elevate Development with AI in SAP Fiori tools . 
 Tip 
This is custom documentation. For more information, please visit SAP Help Portal. 64

If your request does not contain any instructions for a specific supported feature, the generated app will either exclude it, or it will be implemented at SAP Fiori tools AI's own discretion. For example, if SAP Fiori tools AI finds no explicit request for the filters in the list report, the app may contain the filter fields of SAP Fiori tools AI's choice. 
If your request contains instructions for unsupported features, they will either be implemented at SAP Fiori tools AI's own discretion, or not be considered. 
If your request only contains text, SAP Fiori tools AI does not generate object page header features based on your specific requirements, but may use the general description of your app to generate some basic header features. 
SAP Fiori tools AI uses your input to create UI features such as fields and columns but chooses random values to fill these columns with test data. In addition, data from images you have used to represent the page layout is also used to generate test data. The generated test data is only intended for testing the app in preview mode and is stored in a test folder of the generated project. The only exception is the code lists or enum values that are based on the explicit values from your input. These values are treated as properties of associated entities and stored in a data folder. 
By default, all generated apps are draft-enabled and contain standard actions. Other actions are not supported.

A domain security policy, that is applied in some companies, includes localhost, which forces HTTPS to be used in redirected URLs. As a result, when the user attempts to access a website, an error may occur. 
If an SSL protocol error appears after the URL redirection, check the security configuration of your browser. For example, Chrome HSTS configuration can be accessed by entering the following URL address to the browser: chrome://net internals/#hsts. 
Starting a Preview from Terminal

Convert a Project to Use Virtual Endpoints 
Using virtual endpoints allows developers to focus on developing applications. Virtual endpoints are automatically kept up-to-date with new package versions and best practises. 
Prerequisites 
You have SAPUI5 CLI version 3.0.0 or higher installed. For more information, see Migrate to v3 . 
If you have @sap/ux-ui5-tooling installed, it must be version 1.15.4 or higher. 
You have @sap-ux/ui5-middleware-fe-mockserver or cds-plugin-ui5 installed. 
If you use sap/ui/core/util/MockServer or @sap/ux-ui5-fe-mockserver-middleware, you must migrate to @sap-ux/ui5-middleware-fe-mockserver. For more information, see @sap-ux/ui5-middleware-fe-mockserver . 
If you use @sap/grunt-sapui5-bestpractice-build, you must migrate to @ui5/cli. For more information, see @ui5/cli .

Use the sap-ux converter to convert your project to use virtual endpoints. The converter renames the local HTML files, deletes the JavaScript, TypeScript, and test files used for the existing preview functionality, and configures virtual endpoints instead. For more information, see sap-ux convert preview-config . 
To convert your application to use virtual endpoints, perform the following steps: 
Procedure 
1. Launch the converter using one of the following options: 
a. Open the Command Palette ( CMD/CTRL + Shift + P ) and execute the Fiori: Convert Preview Config command. 
b. Open Application Info and click Convert Preview Config. 
2. Press Y to simulate the conversion or N to convert the project. 
3. Press Y to convert the test runners or N to decline. 
Results 
Your application has been converted to use virtual endpoints. For more information about the conversion, see the output in the terminal. 
 Tip 
If you have modified the local HTML files, such as flpSandbox.html, move the modified content to a custom init script for the preview middleware. For more information, see preview-middleware - Migration . If you have not modified the local HTML files, you can delete them.
