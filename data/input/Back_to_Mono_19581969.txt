Back to Mono (1958–1969) is a box set (4 compact discs or 5 vinyl LPs) compilation of the recorded work of record producer Phil Spector, through the 1960s, released in 1991 by ABKCO as #7118-2.

 The first track, "To Know Him Is to Love Him," released in 1958, features Spector performing as part of the group the Teddy Bears.

 Initially a vinyl album-sized package, the box contained a booklet with photographs, complete song lyrics, discographical information, and a reproduction of the essay on Spector by Tom Wolfe, "The First Tycoon of Teen."

 The package also contained a small, round, red "Back to Mono" pin.
