The 2011–12 VCU Rams men's basketball team represented Virginia Commonwealth University during the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

 It was the 44th season of the University fielding a men's basketball program.

 Led by third-year head coach Shaka Smart, the Rams were coming off a season marked by a run to the Final Four.

 Expected to finish lower in the CAA regular season standings, the Rams finished as regular season runners-up with a 15–3 conference record, before winning the 2012 CAA Men's Basketball Championship against Drexel, 59–56, earning their 11th ever berth into the NCAA Tournament.

 It was also the first season since 1984–85 that the Rams consecutively qualified for the NCAA Tournament.
