I"s (アイズ , Aizu ) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masakazu Katsura.

 The story's main character is 16-year-old high school student Ichitaka Seto who is in love with his classmate Iori Yoshizuki, but too shy to tell her.

 Again and again he plans to tell her his true feelings, but each time something (usually a misunderstanding of some kind) gets in the way.

 Things become even more complicated when Itsuki Akiba returns to Japan; she is a girl Ichitaka was friends with in their childhood before she moved to the United States, and who had a huge crush on him.
