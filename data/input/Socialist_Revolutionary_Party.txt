The Socialist Revolutionary Party, or Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries (the SRs; Russian: Партия социалистов-революционеров (ПСР), эсеры , "esery") was a major political party in early 20th century Russia and a key player in the Russian Revolution.

 Its general ideology was revolutionary socialism of democratic socialist and agrarian socialist forms.

 After the February Revolution of 1917, it shared power with other liberal and democratic socialist forces within the Russian Provisional Government.

 In November 1917, it won a plurality of the national vote in Russia's first-ever democratic elections (to the Russian Constituent Assembly), but the October Revolution had changed the political landscape and the Bolsheviks disbanded the Constituent Assembly in January 1918.

 The SRs soon split into pro-Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik factions.

 The anti-Bolshevik faction of this party, known as the Right SRs, which remained loyal to the Provisional Government leader Alexander Kerensky was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of the Russian Civil War and subsequent persecution.
