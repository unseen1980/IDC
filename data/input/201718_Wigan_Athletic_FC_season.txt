The 2017–18 season is Wigan Athletic's 86th year in existence and their first back in League One, after being relegated the previous season.

 Along with competing in the league, the club will also participate in the FA Cup, EFL Cup and EFL Trophy.

 Paul Cook was appointed as manager on 31 May 2017, signing a 3 year deal, following the departure of much of the previous coaching staff the day before.
