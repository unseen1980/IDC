The genus Huernia (family Apocynaceae, subfamily Asclepiadoideae) consists of stem succulents from Eastern and Southern Africa, first described as a genus in 1810.

 The flowers are five-lobed, usually somewhat more funnel- or bell-shaped than in the closely related genus "Stapelia", and often striped vividly in contrasting colours or tones, some glossy, others matt and wrinkled depending on the species concerned.

 To pollinate, the flowers attract flies by emitting a scent similar to that of carrion.

 The genus is considered close to the genera "Stapelia" and "Hoodia".

 The name is in honour of Justin Heurnius (1587–1652) a Dutch missionary who is reputed to have been the first collector of South African Cape plants.

 His name was actually mis-spelt by the collector.
