The Russian Civil War (Russian: Гражда́нская война́ в Росси́и , "Grazhdanskaya voyna v Rossiyi" ; November 1917 – October 1922) was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future.

 The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants.

 In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites.

 Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies.

 The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919.

 The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920.

 Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923.

 The war ended in 1923 in the sense that Red control of the newly formed Soviet Union was now assured, although armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934.

 There were an estimated 7,000,000–12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians.

 The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen.
