The 1995–96 season was Manchester United's fourth season in the Premier League, and their 21st consecutive season in the top division of English football.

 United finished the season by becoming the first English team to win the Double (league title and FA Cup) twice.

 Their triumph was made all the more remarkable by the fact that Alex Ferguson had sold experienced players Paul Ince, Mark Hughes and Andrei Kanchelskis before the start of the season, and not made any major signings.

 Instead, he had drafted in young players like Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Paul Scholes and the Neville brothers, Gary and Phil.
