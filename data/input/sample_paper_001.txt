Machine learning has revolutionized many fields of computer science.

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers.

These networks can learn complex patterns from large amounts of data.

Convolutional neural networks are particularly effective for image recognition tasks.

Recurrent neural networks excel at processing sequential data like text and speech.

Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art results in natural language processing.

Attention mechanisms allow models to focus on relevant parts of the input.

Pre-trained language models like BERT and GPT have democratized NLP applications.

Transfer learning enables models trained on large datasets to be fine-tuned for specific tasks.

The field continues to evolve with new architectures and training methodologies.
