The 1992–93 NBA season was the fifth season for the Charlotte Hornets in the National Basketball Association.

 In the 1992 NBA draft, the Hornets selected center Alonzo Mourning out of Georgetown with the second overall pick.

 With the addition of Mourning, along with second-year star Larry Johnson and Muggsy Bogues, the Hornets struggled around .500 for most of the season, but won 9 of their final 12 games finishing their season third in the Central Division with a 44–38 record, and qualified for their first ever playoff appearance.

 The team became the first of the four expansion franchises of the late 1980s to win a playoff series, when Mourning sunk a 20 ft jumper at the buzzer in Game 4 of the first round playoff series against the 4th-seeded Boston Celtics.

 However, in the semifinals, the Hornets were eliminated by the New York Knicks in five games.
