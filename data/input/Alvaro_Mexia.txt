Alvaro Mexia was a 17th-century Spanish explorer and cartographer of the east coast of Florida.

 Mexia was stationed in St Augustine and was given a diplomatic mission to the native populations living south of St. Augustine and in the Cape Canaveral area.

 This mission resulted in a "Period of Friendship" between the Spanish and the Ais native population.
