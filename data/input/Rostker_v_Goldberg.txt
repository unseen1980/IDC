Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981) , was a decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft was constitutional.

 After extensive hearings, floor debate and committee sessions on the matter, the United States Congress enacted the law, as it had previously been, to apply to men only.

 Several attorneys, including Robert L. Goldberg, subsequently challenged the gender distinction as unconstitutional.

 (The named defendant is Bernard D. Rostker, Director of the Selective Service System.)

 In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court held that this gender distinction was not a violation of the equal protection component of the due process clause, and that the Act would stand as passed.
