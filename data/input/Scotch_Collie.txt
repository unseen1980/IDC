The Scotch Collie is a landrace breed of dog which originated from the highland regions of Scotland.

 The breed consisted of both the long-haired (now known as Rough) Collie and the short-haired (now known as Smooth) Collie.

 It is generally believed to have descended from a variety of ancient herding dogs, some dating back to the Roman occupation, which may have included Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dogs and Viking Herding Spitzes.

 Other ancestors include the Gordon and Irish Setters.
