Mondelez International, Inc., styled Mondelēz ( ), is an American multinational confectionery, food, and beverage company based in Illinois which employs about 107,000 people around the world.

 It consists of the global snack and food brands of the former Kraft Foods Inc after the October 2012 spin-off of its North American grocery operations.

 The Mondelez name, adopted in 2012, was suggested by Kraft Foods employees and is derived from the words "mundus" (Latin for “world”) and "delez" (a proxy for the word "delicious").
