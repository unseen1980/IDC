D1NZ is a production car drifting series in New Zealand.

 There is currently no New Zealand drifting championship so D1NZ is the premier series running as a clubsport advanced event under MotorSport New Zealand.

 It began early in 2003 as a small competition consisting of several drifting teams from all over the country in order to organise and regulate Drifting events on the circuit.

 Since then it has continued to grow larger and more professional, now involving professional drivers with sponsored cars.

 The series now includes two championships: Pro and Pro-sport.

 New competitors generally need to prove themselves in the Pro-sport championship before entering the Pro championship (unless coming from an equivalent international series).

 Organizers aim to promote and educate Drifting in New Zealand, with a regulated safe environment.

 Despite similar moniker, the series is not related to the Japanese D1 Grand Prix series.

 It has been recognised as the longest running drifting series in the world.
