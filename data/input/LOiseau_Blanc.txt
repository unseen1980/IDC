L'Oiseau Blanc (commonly known in the English-speaking world as The White Bird ) was a French Levasseur PL.8 biplane that disappeared in 1927, during an attempt to make the first non-stop transatlantic flight between Paris and New York City to compete for the Orteig Prize.

 The aircraft was flown by French World War I aviation heroes, Charles Nungesser and François Coli.

 The aircraft took off from Paris on 8 May 1927 and was last seen over Ireland.

 Less than two weeks later, Charles Lindbergh successfully made the New York–Paris journey and claimed the prize, flying the "Spirit of St. Louis".
